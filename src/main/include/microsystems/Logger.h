/*      Utility functions for logging state of robot
 *
 *      Action log: called by two macros (LOG and DUMP).
 *      - Puts value descriptions and the corresponding value, with a timestamp,
 *        to a file on the roboRIO that can be accessed through psftp.
 *
 *      Data log:
 *      - Continuously records different values such as encoders, button states, joystick inputs,
 *        motor outputs and current draw
 *
 *      Log is in csv format - easily read by programs like excel, google sheets, etc.
 */

/*
 * Downloading logs from roboRIO: (from forummotion post)
 * 1. open command line (on windows) or terminal (on mac)
 * 2. make sure you are connected to the robot, and type:
 * 			psftp lvuser@roborio-1868-frc.local
 * 	  (you need psftp installed on your laptop)
 * 3. some stuff should come up, if it asks you to store something you can either say y or n.
 * 	  i did y and i'm still alive so it should be fine
 * 4. to see all the files in the directory, type
 *    		dir
 * 5. you should see a file with the format
 * 			YEAR-month-day_hour_minute-actionlog.txt
 * 	  or
 * 	  		YEAR-month-day_hour_minute-datalog.txt
 * 6. type CODE:
 *			get FILENAME
 *	  where FILENAME is the thing mentioned above. type it exactly right!!!
 * 7. if you did it right, it should say that the file was downloaded into your directory or
 *something
 * 8. on windows, navigate to C:\Users\blah where blah is the name of your user on your computer.
 *    the file should be in there somewhere.
 *    on mac, i don't know exactly but it should be under something similar
 * 9. yay you did it! you can do whatever you want with the file now, it should follow a format of
 *    TIMESTAMP, FILENAME, LINE, STATENAME, STATE if you used the action log.
 *    for the data log, it's constantly changing so it's no use putting here but we're working on
 *    added headers to the columns so you can easily tell what each column is about.
 *    check Logger::LogState(...) in Logger.cpp if you're curious
 *
 *
 * TO DELETE ACTION AND DATALOGS:
 * in putty:
 * rm *datalog.txt
 * rm *actionlog.txt
